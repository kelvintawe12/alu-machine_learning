# Linear Algebra

This directory contains implementations of various linear algebra operations in Python, as part of the Mathematics for Machine Learning project.

## Tasks

0. **Slice Me Up**: Slicing arrays using Python list slicing.
1. **Trim Me Down**: Extracting middle columns from a 2D matrix.
2. **Size Me Please**: Calculating the shape of a matrix (nested list).
3. **Flip Me Over**: Transposing a 2D matrix.
4. **Line Up**: Element-wise addition of two arrays.
5. **Across The Planes**: Element-wise addition of two 2D matrices.
6. **Howdy Partner**: Concatenating two arrays.
7. **Gettin’ Cozy**: Concatenating two 2D matrices along a specific axis.
8. **Ridin’ Bareback**: Matrix multiplication using nested lists.
9. **Let The Butcher Slice It**: Slicing numpy arrays.
10. **I’ll Use My Scale**: Calculating shape of a numpy ndarray.
11. **The Western Exchange**: Transposing a numpy ndarray.
12. **Bracing The Elements**: Element-wise operations on numpy arrays.
13. **Cat's Got Your Tongue**: Concatenating numpy arrays.
14. **Saddle Up**: Matrix multiplication using numpy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5+
- Numpy 1.15 (for tasks 9-14)

## Usage

Each task is implemented in its own Python file. Run the scripts directly or import the functions as needed.

For example:
```bash
python3 0-slice_me_up.py
```

Or for functions:
```python
from 2-size_me_please import matrix_shape
print(matrix_shape([[1, 2], [3, 4]]))
