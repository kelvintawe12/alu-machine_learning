# Classification

This folder contains all code for binary and multiclass classification using neural networks.

## Structure
- `0-neuron.py` to `7-neuron.py`: Single neuron binary classification
- `8-neural_network.py` to `15-neural_network.py`: Neural network with one hidden layer
- `16-deep_neural_network.py` to `28-deep_neural_network.py`: Deep neural network (multilayer, multiclass, activations)
- `24-one_hot_encode.py`, `25-one_hot_decode.py`: One-hot encoding/decoding utilities

## Datasets
Place all required `.npz` files in the `data` directory at the root of the project.

## Usage
Run the provided `*-main.py` files to test each implementation. Example:

```sh
python3 0-main.py
```

## Notes
- Datasets are not included in this repository. Obtain them from your course resources.
- See the root `README.md` for overall project info.
