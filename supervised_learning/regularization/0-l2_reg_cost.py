    Calculates the cost of a neural network with L2 regularization.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cost : float
        The cost of the network without L2 regularization.
    lambtha : float
        The regularization parameter.
    weights : dict
        Dictionary of weights and biases of the neural network.
    L : int
